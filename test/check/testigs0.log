Description
    Extract station information from one or more IGS site log files and
    update the station information section (block 2) of a Bernese station
    information file (.STA).

    If a logfilepattern is specified then it can include replacement strings
    {code} for station code and {yyyy} {mm} {dd} {ddd} for year, month, day
    of month, and day of year. Where more than one file is found for a
    station, the most recent one based on the filename date will be used,
    otherwise the file sorting last alphabetically will be used. The search
    for log files will include the specified directory and all child
    directories. Once a log file matching a name is found then only files in
    that directory will be considered for that code. Multiple search
    directories can be specified either separated by ':' or as individual
    command line parameters.

    (Note that the code is used only for file selection - the station code
    for matching the station information file names comes from the contents
    of the log file. However see the -m option).

    Station names are matched either using the four character code, possibly
    combined with the DOMES number, or the full name from the site log. The
    names are matched using the station renaming specified in the station
    information file.

    A Bernese coordinate file can be specified, in which case the program
    will test the approximate coordinate in the site log against that in the
    coordinate file to confirm the match. Stations which are outside a
    tolerance or not in the coordinate file will be ignored.

    If the -u option is specified then only stations in the coordinate file
    are updated, otherwise all stations in the original file are updated. If
    an output coordinate file is specified then the output will be written
    to that.

Options
    Valid options are:

    -p filepattern
        Defines a pattern for the filename. Can include {code} for a station
        code, {yyyy}, {mm}, {dd}, or {ddd} for date components. Also ? and *
        for a single character or arbitrary number of c characters. Results
        in a recursive search of the directory for log files as described
        above.

        When this parameter is used the script expects log directories
        rather than log files on the command line.

        Generally this will be used with the -m option.

    -P  Use default pattern {code}_{yyyy}{mm}{dd}.(xml|log)

    -n  Specify that the site log stations will be linked with the .STA
        stations based on the name.

    -d  Specify that the name will be compiled from the four character code
        and DOMES number (or just the four character code if the DOMES
        number is blank).

    -m  Match codes with the filename. Assumes the {code} pattern in the
        filename matches the four character id, and only uses the file if
        this is identifiable in the station naming section (001) of the STA
        file.

    -c crdfile
        Specify the name of a Bernese .CRD file to use for confirming the
        IGS station name match based on the coordinate.

    -C crdfile
        Similar to -c except that there is no input station information file
        - it is created directly from the log files.

    -a  Specify that logs matching any station code from the coordinate file
        will be added even if they are not already in the station
        information file.

    -t tolerance
        Specify the tolerance in metres used to confirm the name match. The
        default is 10 metres.

    -v  Verbose mode

    -h  Prints help and exits
